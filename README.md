# Enter the darkness

## Description:
Enter the darkness didn't really have a point at all. I just wanted to create some kind of horror game, with cheap jump scares. 
I developed the game while I in 9th grade(last year of the danish school system, before highschool), was an intern at Stone Plant Studios ivs in 2016.

As in the other repositories in "dead projects", this project is, as the name suggests, dead. I wont be updating or maintaining it.
The code in the project does not follow my current style of coding, or up to any standards.
the code is in other words, spaghetti code and properly filled with bugs. 

### Reflection
What have I learned from this project

## Setup:
Either clone the reposity, or import the unity package file.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work.
